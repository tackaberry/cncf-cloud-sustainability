**[CNCF October 2023 Meeting](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-ottawa-presents-kubecon-recap-cncf-sustainability-karpenter-gke-autopilot-and-more/)**

*Thursday, November 28, 2023  @ 6 - 8PM*

As cloud professionals, we have a unique opportunity and important responsibility to make a significant impact on the sustainability of the internet. In this talk I outline key best practices that will help organizations reduce the environmental impact of their cloud usage. This talk skews towards cloud-native and open source concepts. 

The top 10 best practices I outline in the talk are: 

1. Measure and experiment
2. Use the cloud
3. Spatial and temporal optimization for low-carbon
4. Optimize for energy efficiency (and carbon efficiency)
5. Use Async and batch processing
6. Build for Security
7. Use ethical data practices
8. Use Open Source Software
9. Optimize CI/CD
10. Frameworks are your friends
