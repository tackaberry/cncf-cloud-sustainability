# Cloud Sustainability: A Practical Guide for Building a More Sustainable Internet 

## CNCF October 2023 Meeting

**Thursday, November 2, 2023  @ 6 - 8PM**

As cloud professionals, we have a unique opportunity and important responsibility to make a significant impact on the sustainability of the internet. In this talk I outline key best practices that will help organizations reduce the environmental impact of their cloud usage. This talk skews towards cloud-native and open source concepts. 

The top 10 best practices I outline in the talk are: 

1. Use the cloud
2. Choose a region for low-carbon energy and proximity to your users
3. Optimize for energy efficiency and carbon efficiency
4. Cluster Efficiency - eBPF and KEPLER FTW
5. Async and batch processing
6. Security
7. Data practices
8. Use Open Source Software
9. Expand FinOps to include GreenOps
10. Frameworks are your friends
11. (BONUS) Measure and experiment
